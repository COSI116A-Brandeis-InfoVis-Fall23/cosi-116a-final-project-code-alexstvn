    <!-- MOTIVATION: Motivating quesstions + user needs -->
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    <p>The MBTA is an integral part of life in the Boston area, and affects us as Brandeis University students. Public
      transit is important to millions for commuting, taking advantage of opportunities in the city, and staying in
      touch with loved ones. We chose the MBTA dataset for our project because of our belief in the value of enhancing
      MBTA performance, not only for our student body, but also for communities throughout Boston.</p>
    <p>The MBTA system, including high-speed rail, buses, and commuter rail, generates lots of data from daily use.
      However, these data are not readily understandable or useful in typical tabular formats. Visualizations are
      essential for observing and predicting trends and correlations between various aspects of the data. By providing
      an interactive element, our target audience can engage with the data in meaningful, productive ways that lead to
      data-driven decisions.</p>
    <p>For our particular visualization, the problem we wanted to address was how a station’s distance from the center
      of Boston influences its average daily traffic.</p>
    <p>By designing and creating an interactive visualization for MBTA ridership data, we seek to enable MBTA planners,
      designers, and engineers to identify stops on the Red Line that garner the most activity. By allowing MBTA
      employees and city planners to engage directly with Red Line ridership data through our visualization tool, we
      seek to enable informed, data-driven transit solutions for the Red Line. Thus, our objective in visualizing
      ridership data is to provide a model for cities seeking efficient, environmentally friendly, community-serving
      transit solutions.</p>

        <p>We employed bar graph and scatterplot visualizations in our project. For displaying the Average Ons and
          Average Offs data, we used a bar graph, with the stops arranged in order on the x-axis, and each bar mark’s
          length corresponding to how many people get on or off a train at that station on average per day.</p>
      </div>
    </div>     
    <p>We positioned the Average Ons and Average Offs bar graphs side by side, since they display similar trends,
      and the user can easily observe how the number of people getting on a train at the station is directly
      correlated with how many people get off. Brushing and linking techniques enhance these observations; when one
      selects some bars or points in any chart, the corresponding marks are highlighted in the other two charts.</p>
    <p>In the scatterplot below the bar charts, we sort the stops on the x axis in the same order as the bar charts.
      When one brushes over the bar charts and selects some of the stations, the corresponding points in the
      distance graph are also highlighted. Through this technique, we display the inverse relationship between the
      average level of activity in a station and its distance from the city center; the busiest stations tend to be
      closest to the center.</p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.</em></p>
    <p>Our data came from a CSV file downloaded from the <a
        href="https://mbta-massdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/9fea7862501f4c59ab2c001ad6ae19b0/explore">MBTA’s online
        data hub</a>. The fields we used in our visualization are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Stop Name<span class="code"> (stop_name)</span>: </b>a String representing a station in the Red Line. These
        stations represent x-axis positions for our marks in the visualizations, such as points and bars.</li>
      <li><b>Average Ons<span class="code"> (average_ons)</span>: </b>the mean number of people per day who get on a
        train at this Red Line stop for the given time period (example: Harvard Station had 2,238 passengers get on a
        train on an average weekday in Fall 2019)</li>
      <li><b>Average Offs<span class="code"> (average_offs)</span>: </b>the mean number of people per day who get off a
        train at this Red Line stop for the given time period.</li>
      <li><b>Distance to Center of Boston<span class="code"> (distance_to_center)</span>: </b>The distance to city
        center for each station was obtained by collecting the latitude and longitude coordinates for Boston city center
        (42.3601 N, 71.0589 W) and all stops on the Red Line. These coordinates were obtained from the Google Maps links
        on the MBTA station webpages. The distance between the coordinates of the center point and all the stations’
        coordinates was calculated using <a href="https://edwilliams.org/gccalc.htm">Ed Williams' "Great Circle
          Calculator"</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- TASK ANALYSIS -->
    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p><em>Summary of task table.</em></p>

    <p>We had three main tasks for this
      visualization. We wanted to allow users to
      explore the following questions: How does a
      stop’s distance from the city center affect
      ridership? What stops on the Red Line tend to be the busiest? And Is there a
      relationship between Average On and Off (is it a dependent relationship)? We addressed
      these tasks by allowing users to browse the data in our charts, and highlight portions of the data with the brush.
      The linking between the charts ties data together and leads the user to characterize and correlate relationships
      between stop distance from center and daily
      rider traffic. Finally, presenting the charts next to each other allows users to discover relationships across our
      dataset.

      </tr>

          the city center affect ridership?</td>

      <li>Sprint 1</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Switching from Sunburst Chart to Scatter Plot – while 
          attempting to make a sunburst chart, we realized that trying to execute it in D3 and 
          defining the levels were harder than we expected. For the sake of time, we switched to using a scatter plot 
          based on our past experiences with D3.</li>
          <li>
            Changing Data Fields to be Used – When trying to execute our graphs, 
            we also realized that the MBTA data did not provide particular days or times data that we were hoping for, 
            so we also had to change how we wanted to use different fields that related to time (or if we even wanted to use them). For example, 
            instead of seeing if we wanted to look at a 
            particular date/time, 
            we were limited to seeing the season and year.

            Making sure the stop names show up and developing some type of average on and average

          <li>
            Work on some level of basic brushing and linking from the class project.

      <li>Sprint 2</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Focusing on a particular line (Red Line) – We changed our focus to hone in on a 
          particular route (the Red Line) because of the 
          amount of stops for the overall MBTA system making the graphs unreadable.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Steps Towards Final Product</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Changing Scatter Plot Y-Axis – We originally were going to try to analyze each stop on the scatterplot based on 
          the number of service days, but we found that the service days are less of a continuous value 
          (in this context) and used more categorically. We then changed it to distance to have a more continuous y-value that would make 
          the scatterplot more appropriate to use.
        </li>
        <li>
          Switching axes on bar charts - originally we had
           the stops on the y axis and the bars going horizontal, but then we 
           switched the axes of the bar chart to have the stops on the x-axis because of 
          the Gestalt Principles we learned in class.
        </li>

          Fixing brushing and linking: 
          debugging linking issues with the bar charts

    <!-- CONCLUSION -->
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p><em>Short summary of work completed and areas for improvement/future-work.</em></p>

    <p>For this project, we created three plots to visualize aspects of ridership data obtained from the MBTA Open Data Portal. 
      We have completed brushing and linking techniques between the charts to allow the user to highlight different portions of the data and observe 
      correlations and trends. Leading up to this final presentation, we created drafts of sample visualizations to guide us towards our final product. The visualization sketches gave 
      us an overview to think about using stop names, average on, and average off data. </p>
    <p>One improvement could be refining the selector and completing it so that it 
      allows the viewer to toggle views of the bar charts for desired light rail route. Currently we only display the data for the Red Line stops, but it would add a lot to functionality 
      of our visualization if the user could also view data for the Orange, Blue, Green, and Silver Line routes. </p>
