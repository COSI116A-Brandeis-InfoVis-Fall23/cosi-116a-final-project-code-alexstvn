## Data Cleaning Folder
### cleaning_data.py
This python was used to compile data into a csv file as well as to filter out and clean the data.
### data_cleaning_notebook.ipynb
This is a notebook that allows us to check on the data as we clean and filter it. This was used to merge the distances and average data into one csv file.
### csv files
These are the csv files as they are when we first start with them.

## MBTA_Data.csv
This is the filtered and cleaned dataset that we end up using.
It still contains other route's data in addition to Red line.

## MBTA_Data.json
This is the same as MBTA_Data.csv, but in a .json format.

Ideally your data is a CSV file.

**Do NOT overwrite any of these files.**

*Do not commit personally identifying or confidential data!*
If you do so, it is a pain to remove it later and it may have already been crawled by other sources. But [here is how you do so](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository).
